** Usability
- Make sure the [[https://github.com/jjk007/Final-Project-SOFE2715/tree/master/Convex%20Hull#python-dependencies][Python Dependencies]]are installed
- The script is accessible from Command Line and uses python 2.x
- To *run* the program
  - Locate to the directory where ~Convex-hull.py~ is located
  - Run ~python Convex-hull.py any_file_name.csv~ in terminal or CMD
- If your file is located in a sub-directory use:
  - ~python Convex-Hull.py ./subdirectoy_name/any_file_name.csv~
- The program can only parse ~CSV~ files and will give an error output otherwise
- The amount of time taken to generate the Hull is also outputted at the end

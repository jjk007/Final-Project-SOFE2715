** Usability
- Make sure the [[https://github.com/jjk007/Final-Project-SOFE2715/tree/master/K-means#python-dependencies][Python Dependencies]] are installed
- The script is accessible from Command Line and uses python 2.x
- To *run* the program
  - Locate to the directory where ~K-means.py~ is located
  - Run ~python K-means.py file_name.csv K~ in terminal or CMD
  - Here *K* is the number of clusters to be generated
  - *K* should be an integer.
  - The *file_name* and *K* should be passed in order, otherwise an error will be outputted
- If your file is located in a sub-directory use:
  - ~python K-means.py ./subdirectoy_name/any_file_name.csv K~
- The program can only parse ~CSV~ files and will give an error output otherwise
- The amount of time taken to cluster the data and the number of
  iterations done to cluster the data is also outputted at the end
